# Hello, I'm Ghassan!  
👨‍💻 Passionate about software development, always learning new technologies.  
📚 Currently exploring terminal commands and best coding practices.  
🚀 Excited to document my coding journey in this repo!  
# Introduction
I am a passionate developer interested in writing clean and efficient code. My journey in software development has been driven by curiosity and continuous learning.

## Good Developer Mindset
Here’s what I’ve learned from the Good Developer Mindset article:
- **Embrace growth**: Constant learning is key to improvement.
- **Problem-solving first**: Good developers focus on understanding problems before jumping into solutions.
- **Collaboration**: Communication and teamwork enhance productivity.
- **Consistency and persistence**: Progress comes from steady effort and patience.

## Terminal Command Cheat Sheet
The Terminal is a powerful tool that allows developers to navigate and manage systems efficiently. Here are some useful commands I’ve learned:
- `ls` - Lists files and directories.
- `cd [directory]` - Changes the current directory.
- `mkdir [name]` - Creates a new folder.
- `rm [file]` - Deletes a file.

## Markdown Formatting
I’ve applied different Markdown formatting techniques in this README.md:
- **Headers** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure content.
- **Bold & Italic** (`**bold**`, `*italic*`) for emphasis.
- **Lists** (`- item`) to organize information.
- **Code blocks** (`\``) for technical content.
